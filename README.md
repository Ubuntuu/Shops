# Shops

The app is basically a map view that annotates shops, shops are annotated by importing data from a json file.

The main focus of this project is just playing around and learning SwiftUI, MapKit, data handling and parsing.

An app that I have created, for testing out SwiftUI, MapKit and how to handle and import data, for now just handling data as
json file.
